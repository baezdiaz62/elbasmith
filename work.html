              <p>Before starting any workout program consult with your doctor.</p>
  
          Make sure you do a few minutes of warm up before you begin your workout.<br>
    If you can not afford a gym or workout equipment, there are several exercises that you 
    can do at home such as, squats, planks, crunches, jumping jacks, running, walking, and 
    stair climbing. Ask yourself, how many times a day can I work out?  one day a week, three, 
    maybe more? How many minutes can I do? 15 minutes, 30 minutes or even an 1 hour. Set your 
    calendar and for the times you want to workout and devote yourself to them. Always have water 
    handy that's a must.</p></div>
