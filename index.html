            <p>One day I was home flipping through channels on my TV feeling exhausted and down. I stopped at a channel and saw people participating in a race. I immediately got excited from watching them running with so much speed and effort. After watching the race I felt inspired and movitated, right there I made a goal, I was going to get off the couch to run.</p></div>

             <p>How to begin. We need to start with a plan. I did some research and we need to start with a healthy 
             diet, sleep, and a regular excerise routine.<br><br>
             You'll be needing proper shoes. The right shoes are important for your feet, wihout good running shoes 
             you'll have injuries. The shoes need to be comfortable, flexible, and light. Before using your shoes for 
             a race it is best to wear them for a few miles to break them in. Make sure you also get the right socks. 
             Don't buy cotton it makes your feet sweat. Buy running socks they're designed to absorb wetness. Next you 
             need to purchase clothing for running, tops, pants, caps, and/or jackets.
             <p>You'll need a minimum of 8 hours sleep. I've searched the internet for apps to help me sleep, There are 
             many to choose from. I also check The <a href="https://www.nypl.org/">New York Public Library</a>  site for 
             meditation and workout DVDs to help relax for a better sleep and varies excerise programs. Music is also a 
             good choice I like to listen to soft music, classical or instrumentals.</p>
             <p>Everyone has a different body type do not get discouraged with your body, just set a reasonable goal 
             and take it slow.</p>

      <p>
          Before starting any workout program consult with your doctor. <br>
          Make sure you do a few minutes of warm up before you begin your workout.
           
If you can not afford a gym or workout equipment, there are several exercises that you can do at home such as, squats, planks, crunches, jumping jacks, running,<br> walking, and stair climbing...  
Ask yourself, how many times a day can I work out?  one day a week, three, maybe more? How many minutes can I do? 15 minutes,<br> 30 minutes or even an 1 hour. Set your calendar and for the 
times you want to workout and devote yourself to them. Always have water handy that's a must.</div> <br>

      You create the schedule and exercises that fit you. I like to work out hard during the mornings, and do some relaxing yoga at night.
Rest is key, it will help with muscle recovery.
